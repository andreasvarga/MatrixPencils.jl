The Kronecker-canonical form of a matrix pencil `M − λN` basically characterizes the right and left singular structure and the eigenvalue structure of the pencil. The computation of the Kronecker-canonical form may involve the use of ill-conditioned similarity transformations and, therefore, is potentially numerically unstable. Fortunately, alternative staircase forms, called `Kronecker-like forms` (KLFs), allow to obtain basically the same (or only a
part of) structural information on the pencil `M − λN` by employing exclusively orthogonal similarity transformations.
Various KLFs can serve to address, in a numerically reliable way, the main applications of the Kronecker form,
such as the computation of minimal left or right nullspace bases, the computation of eigenvalues and zeros, the determination of the normal rank of polynomial and rational matrices, computation of various factorizations of rational matrices, as well as the solution of linear equations with polynomial or rational matrices.

This collection of Julia functions is an attemp to implement high performance numerical software to compute a range of
KLFs which reveal the full or partial Kronecker structure of a matrix pencil. The KLFs are computed by performing several pencil reduction operations on a reduced basic form of the initial pencil. These operations efficiently compress the rows or columns of certain submatrices to full rank matrices and simultaneously maintain the reduced basic form. The rank decisions involve the use of rank revealing QR-decompositions with colum pivoting or the, more reliable, SVD-decompositions. The overall computational complexity of all reduction algorithms is ``O(n^3)``, where ``n`` is the largest dimension of the pencil.  

The implemented basic pencil reduction operations are described in [1] and [2], and form the basis of the implemented **PREDUCE** procedure described in [3].

A set of functions is provided to address pencil manipulation problems for structured matrix pencils `M − λN` of the forms
`[A - λE B; C D]` or `[A-λE B-λF; C-λG D-λH]`. Matrix pencils with these structure frequently arise from the linearization of polynomial or rational matrices. The computation of least order linearizations is based on algorithms described in [3]-[9].  

A set of functions is available for the manipulation of polynomial matrices specified via their coefficient matrices in a monomial basis. All funtions also support matrix, vector or scalar of elements of the `Polynomial` type
provided by the [Polynomials](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Polynomials.jl) package. Several linearization functions are available which allow the extension of pencil manipulation techniques to matrix polynomials. Some straightforward applications are covered such as the computation of finite and infinite eigenvalues, zeros and poles, the determination of the normal rank, the determination of Kronecker indices and finite and infinite eigenvalue structure, checks of regularity and unimodularity. The implementations follow the computational framework and results developed in [10] and are described in [11].

Balancing techniques for matrix pencils can significantly enhance the reliability of computations and improve the accuracy of computed eigenvalues and zeros. Balancing approaches relying on the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm have been proposed in [15] and served as basis for several functions for balancing matrix pencils.  

The available functions in the `MatrixPencils.jl` package cover both real and complex numerical data.
