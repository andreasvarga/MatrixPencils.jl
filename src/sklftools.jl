    sreduceBF(A, E, B, C, D; fast = true, atol = 0, rtol, withQ = true, withZ = true) -> F, G, Q, Z, n, m, p

Reduce the partitioned matrix pencil `M - λN` 

               | A-λE | B | ndx
      M - λN = |------|---|
               |  C   | D | ny
                  nx    nu  
  
to an equivalent basic form `F - λG = Q'*(M - λN)*Z` using orthogonal transformation matrices `Q` and `Z` 
such that `M - λN` is transformed into the following standard form
 
               | B1 | A1-λE1 | n
      F - λG = |----|--------|   ,        
               | D1 |   C1   | p
                 m      n

where `E1` is an `nxn` non-singular matrix, and `A1`, `B1`, `C1`, `D1` are `nxn`-, `nxm`-, `pxn`- and `pxm`-dimensional matrices,
respectively. The order `n` of `E1` is equal to the numerical rank of `E` determined using the absolute tolerance `atol` and 
relative tolerance `rtol`. The dimensions `m` and `p` are computed as `m = nu + (nx-n)` and `p = ny + (ndx-n)`. 

If `fast = true`, `E1` is determined upper triangular using a rank revealing QR-decomposition with column pivoting of `E` 
and `n` is evaluated as the number of nonzero diagonal elements of the R factor, whose magnitudes are greater than 
`tol = max(atol,abs(R[1,1])*rtol)`. 
If `fast = false`,  `E1` is determined diagonal using a rank revealing SVD-decomposition of `E` and 
`n` is evaluated as the number of singular values greater than `tol = max(atol,smax*rtol)`, where `smax` 
is the largest singular value. 
The rank decision based on the SVD-decomposition is generally more reliable, but the involved computational effort is higher.

The performed left orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Q` if `withQ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Q` is set to `nothing`.   
The performed right orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Z` if `withZ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Z` is set to `nothing`.

and `Q'*B` is returned in `B` (unless `B = missing`).                 

The subpencil `| Ao-λEo |` has full column rank `no`, is in a staircase form, and contains the left Kronecker indices of `M - λN`.

nonzero elements of `A`, the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `E`, 
the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `C`,  and 
the relative tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `E` and `C`.  
The reduction is performed using rank decisions based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting 
if `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`.

The performed orthogonal or unitary left transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Q` if `withQ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Q` is set to `nothing`.   
The performed orthogonal or unitary right transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Z` if `withZ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Z` is set to `nothing`.

where the blocks  `B11`, `B22`, `A31`, ..., `Ap,p-2`  have full row ranks.
The `p`-dimensional vector `νr`, with `p = 2nr` even,  contains the row dimensions of the 
blocks.  The difference `νr[2i-1]+νr[2i]-νr[2i+1]-νr[2i+2]` for `i = 1, 2, ..., nr` is the 
number of elementary Kronecker blocks of size `(i-1) x i`.

The `nuc x nuc` matrix `Auc` contains the (finite) eigenvalues of `M - λN` (also called the uncontrollable eigenvalues of `A`).  

The keyword arguments `atol1`, `atol2`, and `rtol`, specify, respectively, the absolute tolerance for the 
nonzero elements of `A`, the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `B`,  and the relative tolerance 
for the nonzero elements of `A` and `B`.  
The reduction is performed using rank decisions based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting 
if `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`.

The performed orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Q` if `withQ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Q` is set to `nothing`.  

Method: The implemented algorithm [1] represents a specialization of the controllability staircase algorithm of [2] 
to the special structure of the input matrix `B = [B1,B2]`.

where:
(1) `Ar-λEr` is a `mr x nr` full row rank pencil, which contains the right Kronecker structure  
     of `M - λN` and that part of its zeros which lie outside of the domain of interest `Cb` of 
     the complex plane defined by the keyword arguments `disc` and `jobopt`; 
(2)  `Al-lambda*El` is an `nl x nl` regular square pencil with `El` invertible and upper triangular;
(3)  `Bl` is an `nl x ml` matrix, where `ml` is the normal rank 
     of the transfer function matrix `C*inv(λE-A)*B+D`; 
(4)  `Bn` is an invertible matrix of order `nsinf`. 

The column dimensions `(nr, nl, ml, nsinf)` are returned in `dimsc`. 

The full column rank subpencil 

                | Al-λEl | Bl | 
    Ml - λNl := |--------|----|
                |   Cl   | Dl |  

contains the left Kronecker structure of `M - λN` and its zeros lying in the domain of interest `Cb`,
and has the property that `rank [Al-λEl Bl] = nl` provided `rank [A-λE B] = n` for all finite `λ ∈ Cb`
   (finite stabilizability with respect to `Cb`). 
The number of finite zeros lying on the boundary of `Cb`, if available, is returned in `nmszer`, 
otherwise `nmszer` is set to `missing`.  
If `disc = false`, the number of infinite zeros, if available, is returned in `nizer`, 
otherwise `nizer` is set to `missing`. If `disc = true`, `nizer` is set to 0. 
The boundary offset  `β` to be used to assess the zeros on the boundary of `Cb` is specified 
by the keyword parameter `offset`. Accordingly, if `disc = false`, then the boundary of `Cb` contains
the complex numbers with real parts within the interval `[-β,β]`, while if `disc = true`, 
then the boundary of `Cb` contains
the complex numbers with moduli within the interval `[1-β,1+β]`. The default value used for `β` is `sqrt(ϵ)`
 (the machine precision of the element type of `A`). 

The domain of interest `Cb` for the zeros of the pencil `Ml - λNl` is defined as follows:

if `jobopt = none`, then `Cb` is the empty set and no zeros of `M - λN` are included in `Ml - λNl`;
   
if  `jobopt = all`, then `Cb` is the extended complex plane (including infinity) and 
   all zeros of `M - λN` are included in `Ml - λNl`;

if `jobopt = finite`, then `Cb` is the complex plane (without infinity) and 
   all finite zeros of `M - λN` are included in `Ml - λNl`;

if `jobopt = infinite`, then `Cb` is the point at infinity and 
   all infinite zeros of `M - λN` are included in `Ml - λNl`;

if `jobopt = stable`, then, for `disc = false`, `Cb` is the set of complex numbers 
   with real parts less than `-β`, while for `disc = true`, `Cb` is the set of complex numbers 
   with moduli less than `1-β` and all finite zeros of `M - λN` in `Cb` are included in `Ml - λNl`;

if `jobopt = unstable`, then, for `disc = false`, `Cb` is the set of complex numbers 
   with real parts greater than `β` or infinite, while for `disc = true`, `Cb` is the set of complex numbers 
   with moduli greater than `1+β` or infinite and all finite and infinite zeros of `M - λN` in `Cb` are included in `Ml - λNl`;

if `jobopt = s-unstable`, then, for `disc = false`, `Cb` is the set of complex numbers 
   with real parts greater than `-β` or infinite, while for `disc = true`, `Cb` is the set of complex numbers 
   with moduli greater than `1-β` or infinite and all finite and infinite zeros of `M - λN` in `Cb` are included in `Ml - λNl`.

The keyword arguments `atol1`, `atol2`, and `rtol`, specify, respectively, the absolute tolerance for the 
nonzero elements of `M`, the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `N`,  and the relative tolerance 
for the nonzero elements of `M` and `N`. 
The reduction is performed using rank decisions based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting 
if `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`.

The performed left orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the `n x n` matrix `Q` if `withQ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Q` is set to `nothing`.   
The performed right orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Z` if `withZ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Z` is set to `nothing`.  

Method: The reduction algorithm of [1] has been adapted to deal with
several zero selection options.
