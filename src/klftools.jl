    preduceBF(M, N; fast = true, atol = 0, rtol, withQ = true, withZ = true) -> (F, G, Q, Z, n, m, p)

Reduce the matrix pencil `M - λN` to an equivalent form `F - λG = Q'*(M - λN)*Z` using 
orthogonal or unitary transformation matrices `Q` and `Z` such that the pencil `M - λN` is transformed 
into the following standard form
 
                   | B  | A-λE | 
          F - λG = |----|------| ,        
                   | D  |  C   |

where `E` is an `nxn` non-singular matrix, and `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` are `nxn`-, `nxm`-, `pxn`- and `pxm`-dimensional matrices,
respectively. The order `n` of `E` is equal to the numerical rank of `N` determined using the absolute tolerance `atol` and 
relative tolerance `rtol`. `M` and `N` are overwritten by `F` and `G`, respectively. 

If `fast = true`, `E` is determined upper triangular using a rank revealing QR-decomposition with column pivoting of `N` 
and `n` is evaluated as the number of nonzero diagonal elements of the `R` factor, whose magnitudes are greater than 
`tol = max(atol,abs(R[1,1])*rtol)`. 
If `fast = false`,  `E` is determined diagonal using a rank revealing SVD-decomposition of `N` and 
`n` is evaluated as the number of singular values greater than `tol = max(atol,smax*rtol)`, where `smax` 
is the largest singular value. 
The rank decision based on the SVD-decomposition is generally more reliable, but the involved computational effort is higher.

The performed left orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Q` if `withQ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Q` is set to `nothing`.   
The performed right orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Z` if `withZ = true`. 
Otherwise, `Z` is set to `nothing`.

The `nb`-dimensional vectors `ν` and `μ` contain the row and, respectively, column dimensions of the blocks
of the staircase form  `Mri-λNri` such that `i`-th block has dimensions `ν[i] x μ[i]` and

The reduction is performed using rank decisions based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting

contain the row and, respectively, column dimensions of the blocks of the staircase form  `Mil-λNil` such that 
the `i`-th block has dimensions `ν[i] x μ[i]` and has full column rank. The matrix Mil has full column rank and 
the leading `μ[1]+...+μ[nb-1]` columns of `Nil` form a full row rank submatrix. 

The regular pencil `Mi-λNi` is in a staircase form, contains the infinite elementary divisors of `Mil-λNil`,  
`Mi` is upper triangular if `ut = true` and nonsingular and `Ni` is upper triangular and nilpotent. The `nbi`-dimensional vector `νi` contains the dimensions of the 
square diagonal blocks of the staircase form  `Mi-λNi` such that the `i`-th block has dimensions `νi[i] x νi[i]`. 
The difference `νi[i]-νi[i-1] = ν[nbi-i+1]-μ[nbi-i+1]` for `i = 1, 2, ..., nbi` is the number of infinite elementary 
divisors of degree `i` (with `νi[0] = 0` and `μ[nbi+1] = 0`).

The full column rank pencil `Mil-λNil` is in a staircase form, and contains the  left Kronecker indices

of the staircase form  `Mil-λNil` such that the `i`-th block has dimensions `ν[nb-i+1] x μ[nb-i+1]` and has full column rank. 
The difference `ν[nb-i+1]-μ[nb-i+1]` for `i = 1, 2, ..., nb` is the number of elementary Kronecker blocks of size 
`i x (i-1)`. The difference `μ[nb-i+1]-ν[nb-i]` for `i = 1, 2, ..., nb` is the number of infinite elementary 
divisors of degree `i` (with `ν[0] = 0`).

The full column rank pencil `Ml-λNl`, in a staircase form, contains the left Kronecker indices of `M-λN` and has the form

               | Al-λEl |
     Ml-λNl  = |--------|,

The difference `νl[nl-j+1]-μl[nl-j+1] = ν[nl-j+1]-μ[nl-j+1]` for `j = 1, 2, ..., nl` is the number of elementary 
Kronecker blocks of size `j x (j-1)`.
If `ut = true`, the full column rank diagonal blocks of `Ml` are reduced to the form `[Y; 0]` 
with `Y` upper triangular and nonsingular and the full row rank supradiagonal blocks of `Nl` are
reduced to the form `[0 Y]` with `Y` upper triangular and nonsingular. 

`F` and `G` are returned in `M` and `N`, respectively.  

The performed left orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Q` (i.e., `Q <- Q*Q1`) 
if `withQ = true`. Otherwise, `Q` is not modified.   
The performed right orthogonal or unitary transformations are accumulated in the matrix `Z` (i.e., `Z <- Z*Z1`) 
if `withZ = true`. Otherwise, `Z` is not modified.
